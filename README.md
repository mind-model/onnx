# ONNX Model Zoo

[Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)](http://onnx.ai) is an open standard format for representing machine learning models. 
ONNX is supported by a community of partners who have implemented it in many frameworks and tools.

The ONNX Model Zoo is a collection of pre-trained models in the ONNX forma.

We have standardized on [Git LFS (Large File Storage)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to store ONNX model files. To download an ONNX model, navigate to the appropriate Github page and click the `Download` button on the top right.
